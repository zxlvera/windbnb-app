<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

### Reflections
###### Took me quite some time to finish this project. Struggled mainly with React Hooks, pretty sure passing this many props is not a good way to go about this project. Would need to read up more on Component Lifecycle Events. Overall, I am happy with my HTML and CSS skills, especially in making the page responsive.
